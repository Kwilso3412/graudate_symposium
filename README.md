# Graudate Symposium

## Abstract
The perception of great stories has evolved over time. In the 1980s, avid readers cherished works like The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood, The Bourne Identity by Robert Ludlum, and You're Only Old Once by Dr. Seuss. Fast forward to the 2000s, and titles like The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling, and The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins captured readers' imaginations. However, similar to how opinions of critics and the public tend to be different, the same can be said for the literature community. Which makes identifying the best books of the year a bit challenging amidst a plethora of New York Times bestsellers. Enter Goodreads, a platform that offers insight into readers' preferences.

Goodreads serves as a hub for passionate readers, providing a platform for rating, discussing, and discovering new books. Each year, Goodreads compiles a list of the best books based on user votes and ratings. The site creates the list by sorting the books by its rating and how many people voted for the book and what is the score it received. I decided to take the information from this site, combine it with a few other databases and explore the data to see what I could discover by analyzing and visualizing the data.

To finish the project, I employed Python to scrape the various websites, SQL and SQLite to query the large data set and finally R to explore the data. I began by scraping web pages to collect book information (titles, author, price etc.), then stored this data into a database so I could easily manipulate it. After organizing the data into separate queries to draw insights, such as top-rated books in the 1900s and recurring top authors. Using tidyverse and Dplyr in R I analyzed the data and visualized it with ggplot.
